SecureDrop Community Code of Conduct
================================================================================

Preamble:

Like the broader technical and activism communities as a whole, the SecureDrop
team is made up of a mixture of staff and volunteers from all over the world,
working on every aspect of our mission—including operations, software
development, mentorship, and building connections with great people and
organizations.

To work together effectively in a large, diverse and open community, we have a
few ground rules that we expect everyone to adhere to, be it paid staff and
board members, volunteers and event attendees; mentors, veterans, novices, or
those seeking help and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you cannot do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended: a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces and events associated with
SecureDrop. This includes physical offices, GitHub repositories, online chat
systems, the Support Forum, SecureDrop hosted or sponsored events, and any other
forums created by the SecureDrop community which our team uses for communication.
In addition, we take violations of this code outside these spaces into account
when determining a person's ability to participate within them.

================================================================================
Summary
================================================================================

The SecureDrop community should be a place where people feel safe and welcome.
They should enjoy participating in discussions and contributing. To these ends,
members of the community should:

    Be friendly and patient

    Be welcoming, considerate, and respectful

    Be careful in the words they choose

    Listen to each other, and communicate openly and honestly

Members of the community should not:

    Intimidate, harass, or insult each other

    Follow the letter of this Code of Conduct while disregarding its spirit

Members of the community should not hesitate to contact the Community Council if
they feel someone has violated this Code of Conduct, or if they have questions
or concerns.
