# The SecureDrop Code of Conduct

Like the broader technical and activism communities as a whole, the SecureDrop team is made up of a mixture of staff and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of our mission—including operations, software development, mentorship, and building connections with great people and organizations.

To work together effectively in a large, diverse and open community, we have a few ground rules that we expect everyone to adhere to, be it paid staff and board members, volunteers and event attendees; mentors, veterans, novices, or those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you cannot do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended—a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces and events associated with SecureDrop. This includes physical offices, GitHub repositories, online chat systems, the Support Forum, SecureDrop hosted or sponsored events, and any other forums created by the SecureDrop community which our team uses for communication. In addition, we take violations of this code outside these spaces into account when determining a person's ability to participate within them.

## Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
* On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the <a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the Moderation Team immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

**Contact / Moderation Team**:
- Emmanuel Morales - [emmanuel@freedom.press](mailto:emmanuel@freedom.press)
- Trevor Timm - [trevor@freedom.press](trevor@freedom.press)
- heartsucker - [heartsucker@autistici.org](mailto:heartsucker@autistici.org)

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the Moderation Team.

1. Remarks that violate the SecureDrop standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

In the SecureDrop community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow SecureDrop collaborators comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official SecureDrop venues; including official chat channels (Slack, Jitsi, Gitter); GitHub repositories; and all forums under [securedrop.club](https://securedrop.club). For other projects adopting the SecureDrop Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.
